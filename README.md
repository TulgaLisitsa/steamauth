# Vapor - Steam Mobile Authenticator

*A simple mobile steam authenticator for Android and iOS.*


This application was built with the steam power user in mind. While owning multiple steam accounts either for steam trading, bot management or privacy, it certainly helps to have the option to securely store your 2FA credentials on one device, while also having the ability to tranfer those credentials in a secure manner.
